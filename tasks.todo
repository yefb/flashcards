Core engine:
- Add console, so one can for instance reset correct answers.
- Write tests and cross-check against Wordreference or something reliable. Mark as checked: true.
- Metadata: tests for regular verbs should not occur as often as for exceptions (and the metadata needs to be stored elsewhere).
- Add the posibility to undo.
- Extend `verify`: also unknown attrs.

Packs:
- Add `merge` (another yaml file), add pack attribute. Only allow names such as <lang>.<pack>.yml
- Add `unmerge` [pack]: remove items from given pack.
- Add `export`: export pack to a file <lang>.<pack>.yml
- Add `packs`: list all packs.

  ES:
  - Refactor verb to use proper terminology, reflective is not tense.

  Publish:
  - Tag (git) and publish the gem.

  After:
  - Full tests coverage including integration tests.
