Tenses:
- Implement proxying tenses (see informal.rb).
- Fix commands, add participio, gerundio, condicional and imperfecto.
- Write tests and cross-check against Wordreference or something reliable. Mark as checked: true.

Core engine:
- Support multiple documents (so one can have notes and other tests) OR use multiple files (it/README, it/it.yml, it/it.tests.yml).
  # Use: YAML.load_documents
- Metadata: tests for regular verbs should not occur as often as for exceptions (and the metadata needs to be stored elsewhere).
- Switch sides (ask in EN or in ES) (and deal with synonyms again).
  1st run: ask what does todavia mean
  2nd run: ask how do you say todavia
- Add the posibility to undo.
- Add tests such as er vs. estar; por vs. para; me lo (order).
  {prompt: "Voy ____ el autob√∫s. (por 1 para 2)", answer: "por"}
- Extend `verify`: also unknown attrs.

Packs:
- Add `merge` (another yaml file), add pack attribute. Only allow names such as <lang>.<pack>.yml
- Add `unmerge` [pack]: remove items from given pack.
- Add `export`: export pack to a file <lang>.<pack>.yml
- Add `packs`: list all packs.

  ES:
  - Refactor verb to use proper terminology, reflective is not tense.

  Publish:
  - Tag (git) and publish the gem.

  After:
  - Full tests coverage including integration tests.
